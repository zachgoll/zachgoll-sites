An environment variable can come in two sizes--global or local. A global environment variable is one that is set upon initialization of a shell and can be used across all your shells. A local environment variable is one that is set during a shell session and is erased when the shell is closed. To create a local environment variable, just export it in your shell.

```bash
export MY_VARIABLE="some value"
```

You can use this as long as the shell is still open.

```bash
echo $MY_VARIABLE # some value
```

As soon as you close the shell, this will no longer be a variable. If you want to create a global variable, you will need to export it in one of your bash configuration files. It is recommended that you place it in the `~/.profile` file as described in [this tutorial](/blog/2019/user-permissions/).

```bash
# ~/.profile

export GLOBAL_VARIABLE="some value"
```

To see all of the environment variables in your current environment (both local and global), you can type the following command.

```bash
env
```

## Shell Variables

Oftentimes, users will get confused when talking about _environment_ variables and _shell_ variables. Regardless of whether the environment variable is local or global, all the scripts running in that shell session will have access to the variable. With a shell variable, other scripts will not have access to it. The following is how we declare a shell variable.

```bash
MY_SHELL_VARIABLE="some value"

echo $MY_SHELL_VARIABLE  # some value
```

This variable will not be available to any script until we export it and make it an environment variable.

```bash
export MY_SHELL_VARIABLE
```

## PATH variable

The most important global environment variable that you must set is the `PATH` variable. This is the variable that tells the bash shell where to find different executable files and scripts. The shell will check the directories listed in the `PATH` variable for the script you are trying to find. Here is an example path.

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

With this example path, when you try to run a script in the terminal such as `cat`, bash will first look in the `/usr/local/bin` for this command. If it doesn't find it there, it will look in `/usr/bin`, and finally, `/bin`. If you need to modify the path, you can update it in your `~/.profile` like so:

```bash
export PATH=/home/zach/script-location:$PATH
```

This will add the `/home/zach/script-location` directory to the beginning of the `PATH` variable. If you want to add it at the end, you can change the line to this:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/zach/script
```

With this new knowledge, we can create our own scripts and add those scripts to our path so we can run them automatically. Let's create a directory in our home folder that will hold all our custom scripts.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir bin
touch bin/my-simple-script
```

Add the following to `my-simple-script`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "I am a useless script for tutorial purposes only"
```

Now make the script executable.

```bash
chmod 775 my-simple-script
```

We need to add the new `bin/` directory to our path. Open `~/.profile` (or wherever you define your `PATH` environment variable), and add the following line.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
```

Finally, you need to source `~/.profile` to activate this new change.

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

You can now run your simple script from the command line by typing the name of it.

```bash
my-simple-script
# I am a useless script for tutorial purposes only
```
