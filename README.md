This repo is a collection of all my personal sites and projects.

After spending countless hours building and re-building my personal site, trying all too hard to make it look "perfect", I decided it's about time to embrace the fact that my personal site will never be "done". I also realized that building a "polished" and "finished" personal website took most of the enjoyment out of the process. I have enough deadlines to hit in my professional life already--definitely don't need this project feeling like one too.

So in light of this, here's my very imperfect, permanently "under construction" personal site. I try to limit my work on this to those times when I genuinely feel like it, so you might find some sloppy code, incomplete articles, and [outdated dependencies](https://github.com/zachgoll/zachghttps://github.com/zachgoll/zachgoll-sitesoll-sites) (sorry dependabot).
